# Color Contrast (a React app)
Based on Swipe's inhouse Contrast tooling

## What is the point of this?
Accessibility is a big topic right now, this tool will create a set of swatches from a single hex code.
Upon hitting select, contrast values show in relation to what color is selected.

## Roadmap
* I still want to dynamically display the maximum contrast value on the selected color.    
  *Use case*: I want to use this color, but want to quickly see what's the maximum contrast I can achieve from my set of colors.

* All the error handling.      
  I used this project to learn Context API and React Hooks, a global state thanks to a few articles etc. I haven't implemented any error handling yet. I've only just gotten the simple functionality working
